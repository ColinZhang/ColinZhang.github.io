<p>SSH (Secure Shell) is a must-have tool for many developers who heavily rely on
SSH to script and manage their remote servers. However, using SSH in reality is
often not as handy as I&rsquo;d expect.</p>

<ul>
<li>For example,
if the remote server is behind a firewall or NAT (which is often the case when
you&rsquo;re using servers owned by enterprises or universities), SSH
requires additional configuration or you&rsquo;d have to setup a VPN prior to SSH.
VPN is not that bad but it slows down the network quite
significantly, as least in my case I can feel the latency.</li>
<li>Even worse, if your remote server sits behind a router, say you have
a Linux box at home, with no dedicated public IP from you IPS, it&rsquo;s quite not
easy to get SSH works. You need to configure port forwarding on the
router, and figure out a way to broadcast the IP address.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="../cano-ssh.png" alt="Inconvenient using case of SSH" /></p>

<p>All these inconveniences dwarf the handy nature of SSH. But we&rsquo;ll not
live with it. Fortunately, SSH is built-in
with abilities to mitigate this &mdash; reverse SSH, aka SSH tunneling is a powerful
feature yet some explanation is required to understand how it works and
how to setup a hassle-free access to your remote server using this technique.</p>

<h1 id="step-by-step-setup:f8b878aefe833ac195c03c37c2641d27">Step-by-step setup</h1>

<p>The setting I&rsquo;m dealing with is illustrated in the following figure. There
are three parties involved:</p>

<p><img src="../aws-ssh.png" alt="figure2" /></p>

<ul>
<li>the remote server, with hostname <code>cs</code></li>
<li>a cloud server with public IP, with hostname <code>aws-ssh</code></li>
<li>the client, running ordinary <code>ssh</code> client</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="setup-reverse-tunnel:f8b878aefe833ac195c03c37c2641d27">setup reverse tunnel</h2>

<p>To setup a reverse tunnel, one need firstly to inform the cloud server of
the identity of our remote server, the other end-point of this SSH tunnel
being established. To this end, execute this on the remote server:</p>

<pre><code>ssh -fN -R 7000:localhost:22 -i aws-key.pem ec2-user@52.10.241.71
</code></pre>

<p>This command tell the cloud server (<code>52.10.241.71</code>) to forward all traffic
going to port 7000 to 22 on the other end of this channel.
In other words, if connecting to <code>52.10.241.71:7000</code>, all traffic eventually
arrives at 22 port on remote server. Other parameters are also important,</p>

<ul>
<li><code>-f</code>: requests ssh to go to background just before command execution</li>
<li><code>-N</code>: do not execute a remote command</li>
<li><code>-i</code>: read in <code>aws-key.pem</code> as login the cloud server</li>
</ul>

<p>To test whether reverse tunnel works, try to connect to <code>localhost:22</code>
on the AWS Server:</p>

<pre><code>ssh fanz@localhost -p 7000
</code></pre>

<p>If prompted with login, great, it works!</p>

<h2 id="connect-from-clients:f8b878aefe833ac195c03c37c2641d27">connect from clients</h2>

<p>Okay now we have a reverse tunnel working on the AWS server. Let&rsquo;s move on to
accept connections from clients. The simplest way for
a client to connect to the remote server is to chain SSH commands in this way,</p>

<pre><code>ssh -i aws-key.pem ec2-user@52.10.241.71 'ssh fz84@localhost -p 7000'
</code></pre>

<p>Straightforward as it seems, this method has a major drawback &ndash; it degraded
security. Owners of the immediate AWS server can witness all traffic if
he/she wants.</p>

<p>A better approach to this end is to use <code>ProxyCommand</code> feature, introduced in
OpenSSH v1.2. On the client, add the following to <code>~/.ssh/config</code>:</p>

<pre><code>Host aws-ssh
      HostName 52.10.241.71
      User ec2-user
      IdentityFile aws-key.pem

Host cs
    User fz48
    ProxyCommand ssh -W localhost:7000 aws-ssh
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><code>Host</code>: Defines for which host or hosts the configuration section applies.
The section ends with a new Host section or the end of the file.</li>
<li><code>User</code>: Defines the username for the SSH connection. Useful if your username
on the remote host is different from your local username.</li>
<li><code>HostName</code>: Defines the literal hostname for the remote server. Useful if a
nickname for the host is used in the Host line.</li>
<li><code>ProxyCommand</code>: Specifies the proxy command for the connection. This command is
launched prior to making the connection to Hostname.</li>
<li><code>-W host:port</code>: Requests that standard input and output on the client be
forwarded to host on port over the secure channel.</li>
</ul>

<p>The final mistery left is which command we should use to connect to <code>cs</code>.
It turn out to be very simple. Just type in <code>ssh cs</code>. It just works!
By doing this, the ProxyCommand is firstly executed, which forwards <code>STDIN</code>
and <code>STDOUT</code> to <code>localhost:7000</code>, then login to <code>aws-ssh</code>. Since we already
have a reverse tunnel &ldquo;listening&rdquo; on port 7000, whatever I/O happens toward
terminal is forwarded to that port, then the final stop, port 22 on <code>cs</code>.</p>
